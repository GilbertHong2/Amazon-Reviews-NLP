# Amazon-Reviews-NLP
Use Unsupervised Learning Models and NLP Techniques to Cluster Amazon Product Reviews

This project uses the amazon reviews dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html to try to find potential patterns in the dataset with unsupervised learning and NLP techniques. It explored three possible models: a Logistic Regression Model, a Random Forest Model and a K Nearest Neighbor Model. The models are fitted using the scikit learn library and the hyperparameters are tuned using grid cross validation.

All details of the project is contained in main.ipynb, the used dataset is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/192JMR7SIqoa14vrs7Z9BXO3iK89pimJL/view.
