# Amazon-Reviews-NLP
Use Unsupervised Learning Models and NLP Techniques to Cluster Amazon Product Reviews

This project uses the amazon reviews dataset from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html to try to find potential patterns in the dataset with unsupervised learning and NLP techniques. It explored two possible ways: one using the general k-means clustering, and the other using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The models are fitted using the scikit learn library and these reviews are clustered into 5 different topics.

All details of the project is contained in main.py, the used dataset is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/192JMR7SIqoa14vrs7Z9BXO3iK89pimJL/view.
